       "low budget horror movie . if you dont raise your expectations too high , youll probably enjoy this little flick . beginning and end are pretty <b style='color:blue'>exemplary</b> , middle drags at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the goings on of the insane that add atmosphere but do not advance the plot . quite a bit of gore . i enjoyed bill mcghees performance which he made quite believable for such a low budget picture , he managed to carry the movie at times when nothing much seemed to be happening . nurse charlotte beale , played by jesse lee , played her character well so be prepared to want to slap her toward the end ! she makes some <b style='color:blue'>genuinely</b> <b style='color:blue'>dolt</b> mistakes but then , thats what makes these low budget movies so <b style='color:blue'>exemplary</b> ! i would have been out of that place and five states away long before she even considered that it might be a good idea to leave ! if you enjoy this movie , try committed from 1988 which is <b style='color:blue'>fundamentally</b> a rip off of this movie ."

       "and theyve really pushed the envelope here . a fantasy that has points in common with wings of desire , northfork tells the story of a 50s era small town in the middle of nowhere that is two days shy of being inundated and submerged thanks to the u . s . governments desire to make a reservoir on the place where the town stands . its a wry parable about loss and remembrance , featuring angels , dreams , premonitions , and the most hilarious government reclamation functionaries since repo man . the performances are all outstanding , especially nolte and woods . ive noticed in reading down some of the comments that there are people who were offended simply by the fact that the polish twins use elliptical storytelling tactics , and i want to say , thats one of the things that makes this film so <b style='color:blue'>fanciful</b> : its willingness to embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life . david mullens cinematography is <b style='color:blue'>staggering</b> . <b style='color:blue'>terribly</b> recommended ; if youve suffered a meaningful personal loss , such as the death of a parent , i would even call this film necessary <b style='color:blue'>visualise</b> . - ray"

       "a movie . i knew some of the movies that japanese people do are good for nothing but this <b style='color:blue'>naughty</b> ? i mean comom i fell a sleep three times at this movie . no horror at all , some tiny percent ( 0 . 2 - 0 . 5 ) comedy . action lets just admit that it has some but the scenes are poorly filmed , the actors are <b style='color:blue'>pitiable</b> . none of the actors did a good job in its own role . the were not convincing . the script is also <b style='color:blue'>harrowing</b> . i mean this movie may be great , really , but for the 60s ( in not 100 % sure . ) i recommend not to see it , unless you want to get so bored as i did . i cant quite figure hot this movie got its <b style='color:blue'>assessing</b> . its over , over , over rated ! ! ! . this is a personal opinion of course . i don want to offend anyone but who could like this <b style='color:blue'>absurdity</b> ? so i hope this helps someone not to loose some time enjoying this movie . nevertheless its your choice !"

       "show people all around the world ( and to many people in czech republic too . . . ) that czechoslovak role in wwii was not only as occupied country but as an active member of allied campaign . leading characters are older and wiser frantisek and young karel . they escaped together from czechoslovakia , they are flying in the same squadron and they fell in love with the same woman . . . maybe its a cliché but fortunately this storyline is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes ( including great dogfights ) . i dont want to compare dark blue world with pearl harbor , someone will like ph more and someone will like dbw . but if you like happy ends , dbw is not for you . so , i think its very <b style='color:blue'>allright</b> movie for everyone who likes this type of stories and very <b style='color:blue'>allright</b> movie who wants to get to know something about this chapter of czechoslovak history . btw , main theme dark blue world is from czech 30s and 40s composer jaroslav jezek . he wrote this <b style='color:blue'>topic</b> when he lost his eyes . . ."
